I am very happy that you are here to read my code,      
and, if there's any problem, please report it to me.     
Plus, don't care about the easteregg, that's just pure shit.      
# The RURI_CONTAINER struct:
All configs of a container are defined in this struct, it's a very large struct.      
# cprintf() and libk2v:
cprintf() is the implementation of printf() with color, it's just for output.      
libk2v is the implementation of config file.      
# base function call graph:
```
main() => ruri() =>|| => other util func
                   |- enable unshare? => ruri_run_unshare_container() => ruri_run_chroot_container()
                   |- enable rootless? => ruri_run_rootless_container() => ruri_run_rootless_chroot_container()
                   |- none? => ruri_run_chroot_container()
```
And, panic() will catch core signal, detect_suid_or_capability() will check if there is SUID or caps on ruri binary.
